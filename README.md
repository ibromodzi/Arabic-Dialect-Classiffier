# Arabic-Dialect-Classiffier
The Arabic Dialect Classifier is a demonstration of how to preprocess Arabic text data and subsequently classify it into distinct dialects using various machine learning techniques. With a focus on enhancing your understanding of natural language processing in the context of Arabic, this project offers insights into text cleaning, feature extraction, and model training.


## Files

Arabic_dialect_classifier.ipynb: This Jupyter Notebook contains the main project code. It demonstrates the steps of Arabic text preprocessing and the implementation of different machine learning algorithms for dialect classification.

MADAR-Corpus-26-dev.tsv: This file contains the development dataset for the project. It's used for testing and validation purposes.

MADAR-Corpus-26-train.tsv: This file contains the training dataset used to train the machine learning models.

README.md: You're currently reading this file! It provides an overview of the project, instructions, and details about the available files.

## Usage

You can start by opening the Arabic_dialect_classifier.ipynb Jupyter Notebook. This notebook guides you through the entire process, from data preprocessing to model training and evaluation.
The dataset files (MADAR-Corpus-26-dev.tsv and MADAR-Corpus-26-train.tsv) are essential for running the code successfully. Make sure they are in the same directory as the Jupyter Notebook.
